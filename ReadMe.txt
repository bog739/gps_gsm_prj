-> This project was started with gps and gsm modules
on a simple plastic board with attached cables for
TTL conversion for USB and Pycharm was used to link up
with devices. 

-> Virtual environment for 
python interpreter for desktop was left here if anyone
want to build it, files for pcb and scheme is yet to come !!

-> In meantime the development of this project started on Pi pico, and
Thonny IDE is used afterwards, MicroPython plugin for Pycharm is not
so great. Although, Thonny IDE needs some improvement for USB communication, but for this 
issue a  reset button was attached for Pi pico to re-enable the communication.
